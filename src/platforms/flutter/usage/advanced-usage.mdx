## Requirements

- For the use of the SDK, the minimal required Dart SDK version is `2.8.0` and Flutter SDK version is `1.17.0`

## Uploading Debug Symbols (Android and iOS)

- [iOS dSYM files](/platforms/apple/dsym/)
- [Android NDK](/product/cli/dif/#uploading-files) Do it manually, Do not use the `uploadNativeSymbols` flag from the Sentry Gradle Plugin, it's not supported yet.
- [Android Proguard/R8 mapping file](/platforms/android/proguard/)
- [Flutter Web Source maps](/product/cli/releases/#managing-release-artifacts)

## Known limitations

- Flutter `split-debug-info` flag isn't supported yet, if this feature is enabled, Dart stack traces are not useful
- Flutter `obfuscate` flag isn't supported yet, if this feature is enabled, Dart stack traces are not useful

## Tips for catching errors

- Use a `try/catch` block
- Use a `catchError` block for `Futures`
- The SDK already runs your init `callback` on an error handler, e.g. using `runZonedGuarded`, are captured automatically
- Flutter-specific errors (such as layout failures), e.g. using `FlutterError.onError`, are captured automatically
- `Isolate` errors on the `current` Isolate which is the equivalent of a main/UI thread, e.g. using `Isolate.current.addErrorListener`, are captured automatically (Only for non-Web Apps).
- For your own `Isolates`, add an `ErrorListener` and call `Sentry.captureException`
